# community-needs
WordPress Plugin for maintaining a list of requested items for multiple users

NOTE: this was built in 2017 in a hectic rush to help my local community to recover from a disastrous fire
it is in no way well built or even working from this repo, but it worked and helped many
perhaps with some time and help it can be made easily used for other in similar situations

# installation

(typically /wp-content/plugins/)
